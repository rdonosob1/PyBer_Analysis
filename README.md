# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview

The aim of this analysis consists in generating consolidated reports by merging two different sources of data (CVS files) in order to compare different ridesharing services among rural, urban and suburban areas to further evaluate and determine affordability of such a service among undeserved neighborhoods. This includes total rides, drivers and fares, as well as averages of both fares per ride and fares per driver. All these is also classified by type of city. 
An additional and interesting factor that was also taken into consideration during the analysis is the date of the rides. 

## Results

After the whole analysis was executed, we found a total of 2,375 rides divided in 125 rural, 625 suburban and 1,625 urban rides. Likewise, the total number of drivers was 78, 490 and 2,405 in the same order. In addition to that, we were able to identify the total amount of fares per type of city as well as the average fare per ride, and the average fare per driver too, as shown below.

Given the fact that there is a greater population density in urban cities, the total of drivers is higher in urban areas than suburban and rural cities. Likewise, the total of fares where transactions in urban cities totaled close $40K, whereas transactions in suburban cities and rural cities where around $19.4K and $4.3K respectively. 
On the other hand, the average fare per ride as well as the average fare per driver has an opposite behavior to be inversely proportional, due to a higher competitivity in bigger cities will result in lower costs.  The following line chart illustrates these findings.

Something interesting with this analysis is that during the end of February there is a slight and similar spike in the total fare ($) across the 3 types of cities.   It may need some additional data to find more correlation with other variables, such as temperature, weather, seasons, etc. 

## Summary
Finally, it is clear than higher the amount of population per city, more service providers and therefore lower rates. Also, closer distances, lower rates.  Contrary to that, lower the population, less demand and therefore a smaller number of rides. Similarly, less demand, less drivers too who are more focused on servicing among the urban(populated) cities. Likewise, farther distances higher cost per ride. 

### Recommendations

-	Study different scenarios and strategies to find ways to become more competitive and try to reduce the tariff in both suburban and rural cities. On the other hand, it will attract more customers and generate more revenue. 
-	Provide incentives to customers in urban areas where it may be very competitive with other carriers in order to gain market share. 
-	Think about investing in hybrid vehicles for long-distance rides to be able to be more competitive and gain some market share among suburban and rural cities.
